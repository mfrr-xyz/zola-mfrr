title = "About Me"
+++
I have been on the internet since the era of dial-up connection (somewhere around 2005). I started my interest in computers when I found a book entitled "Windows Secrets".
As much as I enjoyed flash games, I started learning Flash MX and began coding in ActionScripts.

Because of outdated information in IT books, I began googling and surfing Wikipedia as a hobby. During my secondary school, I started programming in VB and became good at math with it. In the meantime, I began my enthusiasm on Windows 7 UI and did a lot of studies and practices. Soon, I started working on projects using .NET and Laravel professionally.

As my interest in .NET and UI began to decline, I casually used modern languages like Python, Go and Rust and later secured job positions with the skills.
Over the time, I became proficient in agile software development using CI/CD, DevOps, virtualization, containerization and some parts in cloud technologies. With confidence, I  led my team projects and deliver high quality releases.

I am also a former chess player, a graphic designer, an illustrator, an IT technician and an online trader for IT parts and gadgets.
Sometimes, I do personal tutoring and mentoring for IT related topics. These days, I am looking for new things to discover, preferrably something less-likely related to coding or technology I have worked on.
